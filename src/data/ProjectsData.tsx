    subtitle: "An android application for navigation in Soekarno-Hatta Airport",
    description: [
      "As my bachelor's thesis project at Tomsk State University, I developed an Android application focused on solving navigation challenges in dynamic airport environments. The project began as a personal challenge to implement pathfinding algorithms—a domain I had little prior experience in—while accounting for frequently changing layouts like Soekarno-Hatta International Airport's terminal structures. Without existing dataset, I designed the system to be easily reconfigurable for layout updates, ensuring long-term usability. Recognizing that navigation alone wouldn’t fully address travelers’ needs, I expanded the scope to integrate flight management features.",
      "The application offers two core functionalities that address different aspects of airport navigation. First, it provides step-by-step indoor navigation where users can select starting points and destinations, with zoomable maps for better orientation in complex terminal spaces. Second, it integrates flight management features including real-time flight searches by IATA code, complete schedules for arrivals and departures at Soekarno-Hatta, and customizable flight reminders. These combined features create a seamless experience where passengers can navigate terminals while staying informed about their flights, all within a single application.",
      "For the technical implementation, I selected the A* pathfinding algorithm for its efficiency and its grid-based nature that is easy to be reconfigured for often layout changes. The application was built using Flutter and Dart to ensure cross-platform compatibility from the start. Flight data is pulled in real-time through integration with the Airlabs API, the MVVM architecture was chosen to maintain clean separation of concerns and improve long-term maintainability, and HiveBox plugin for local storage. This project represents my ability to transform academic research into practical solutions while addressing real-world usability challenges.",

    description: [
      "During my studies at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, I collaborated with a team to develop YouMart, an Android application designed to address a real-world problem faced by students at our dormitory’s convenience store. The store had unpredictable operating hours, and even when open, stock availability was inconsistent—making it frustrating for students who needed quick access to essentials. As part of a course project, we partnered with the store as stakeholders to create a digital solution that would bring transparency and convenience to both customers and the store owner.",
      "The app serves two user roles: customers and the store owner. For customers, it provides real-time updates on store status (open/closed) and live inventory, eliminating the need for physical checks. Users can browse available items, place orders for pickup, and view their order history—with the option to reorder past purchases seamlessly. Guest login is supported, though order history is restricted to registered accounts. On the admin side, the store owner can manage inventory (add/update/remove items), adjust opening hours, and monitor incoming orders—all through an intuitive interface. The order feature reduces in-store browsing time, streamlining operations for both parties.",
      "Built with Flutter and Dart, the app leverages GetX for state management and follows an MVC architecture for scalability. Firebase Firestore powers the user authentication process and real-time database, ensuring instant updates for inventory and store status—a critical feature for reliability. The project was a hands-on lesson in solving tangible problems with user-centric design and efficient technical execution."

Merchants can register their businesses (lodging, vehicle rentals, culinary spots, or excursions) with detailed profiles, including facilities, operating hours, photos, and descriptions. Travelers, after setting their arrival/departure dates, can build personalized itineraries by adding merchant services at specific times. The app also provides business details, past travel history tracking, and user account management—creating a seamless end-to-end travel planning experience.",
